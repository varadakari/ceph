>= 11.0.0
------

* The list of monitor hosts/addresses for building the monmap can now be
  obtained from DNS SRV records. The service name used in when querying the DNS 
  is defined in the "mon_dns_srv_name" config option, which defaults to
  "ceph-mon".

* The 'osd class load list' config option is a list of object class names that
  the OSD is permitted to load (or '*' for all classes). By default it
  contains all existing in-tree classes for backwards compatibility.

* The 'osd class default list' config option is a list of object class names
  (or '*' for all classes) that clients may invoke having only the '*', 'x',
  'class-read', or 'class-write' capabilities. By default it contains all
  existing in-tree classes for backwards compatibility. Invoking classes not
  listed in 'osd class default list' requires a capability naming the class
  (e.g. 'allow class foo').

* The 'rgw rest getusage op compat' config option allows you to dump the description of user stats
  or not in s3 GetUsage API. This config option is of bool type and defaults to false.
  If the value is true, the reponse data of s3 GetUsage like below:

    "stats": {
                "TotalBytes": 516,
                "TotalBytesRounded": 1024,
                "TotalEntries": 1
             }

  Or if the value is false, the  reponse of s3 GetUsage like below and as it does before we add this config option:

    {
         516,
         1024,
         1
    }.

* If your monitors are configured to use the experimental rocksdb
  backend, you may need to manually adjust the store before upgraded.
  Monitors now explicitly record what keyvalue backend type they use.  If
  the kv_backend file is missing from the mon_data directory (normally
  /var/lib/ceph/mon/$cluster-$name/kv_backend) it is now assumed to be leveldb.
  If you had manually configured the mon to use rocksdb, this file should
  be created and filled with the string "rocksdb" (newline optional).

* The 'osd out ...' and 'osd in ...' commands now preserve the OSD
  weight.  Previously the mons would only preserve the weight if the
  mon automatically marked and OSD out and then in, but not when an
  admin did so explicitly.

* The 'ceph osd perf' command will display 'commit_latency(ms)' and 
  'apply_latency(ms)'. Previously, the names of these two columns are 
  'fs_commit_latency(ms)' and 'fs_apply_latency(ms)'. We remove the prefix 
  'fs_', because they are not filestore specific. 

OSD: change the prefix from fs_* to os_*, because commit_latency and …
…apply_latency will be used not only for filestore.

11.0.0
------

* If you have manually specified the monitor user rocksdb via the
  ``mon keyvaluedb = rocksdb`` option, you will need to manually add a file
  to the mon data directory to preserve this option::

     echo rocksdb > /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-`hostname`/kv_backend

  New monitors will now use rocksdb by default, but if that file is
  not present, existing monitors will use leveldb.  The ``mon keyvaluedb`` option
  now only affects the backend chosen when a monitor is created.

* The 'osd crush initial weight' option allows you to specify a CRUSH
  weight for a newly added OSD.  Previously a value of 0 (the default)
  meant that we should use the size of the OSD's store to weight the
  new OSD.  Now, a value of 0 means it should have a weight of 0, and
  a negative value (the new default) means we should automatically
  weight the OSD based on its size.  If your configuration file
  explicitly specifies a value of 0 for this option you will need to
  change it to a negative value (e.g., -1) to preserve the current
  behavior.

* The `osd crush location` config option is no longer supported.  Please
  update your ceph.conf to use the `crush location` option instead.

* The static libraries are not included by the debian development packages
  (lib*-dev) any more. As it is not required per debian packaging policy.
  And their shared versions are packaged as before.

* The libtool pseudo-libraries (.la files) are not included by the debian
  development packages (lib*-dev) any more. As it is unneeded, and per
  https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/LAFileRemoval and
  https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/advanced.en.html,
  we should remove them.

* The jerasure and shec plugins can now detect SIMD instruction at runtime
  and no longer need to be built for different processors. The following 
  plugins are now deprecated: jerasure_generic, jerasure_sse3, jerasure_sse4, 
  jerasure_neon, shec_generic, shec_sse3, shec_sse4, and shec_neon. If you use any
  of these plugins directly you will see a warning in the mon log file.
  Please switch to using just 'jerasure' or 'shec'.
